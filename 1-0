Best Case: O(n) - When the input list is already sorted, it makes only n comparisons and no swaps.
Average Case: O(n^2) - In the average case, it makes roughly n^2/4 comparisons and swaps.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the input list is sorted in reverse order, causing the maximum number of comparisons and swaps.
